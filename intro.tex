		\item Imagine you're working on an important document and suddenly\dots
		\item Nothing is working anymore, your document probably lost.
		\item You don't perceive this as opportunity to learn more about Computers, how they work and why they fail
		\item It's not an invitation to get more familiar with them. (Even though it absolutely is.)
		\item It's the task that's important, the computer is just a way to solve a task, it should not be the cause of other problems that
			maybe you have no idea how to deal with
